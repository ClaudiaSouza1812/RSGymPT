Project Summary: RSGymPT - Gym Personal Training Management System
A console-based application for managing personal training sessions at a gym, handling users, trainers, and training schedules.
Key Technical Highlights:

- Languages & Frameworks:

C# (.NET Framework 4.7.2)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Architecture & Design Patterns:

1 - Clean Architecture principles:
Clear separation of concerns
Modular design with distinct class responsibilities
Internal access modifiers for encapsulation

2 - OOP Best Practices:
Inheritance and encapsulation
Property auto-implementation (C# 2.0)
Bodied expression properties (C# 3.0)
Strong type safety

- Security Features:

Password encryption using SHA256
Secure password input handling
Access control through user authentication

- Data Structures & Algorithms:

Efficient use of Collections (Lists, Dictionaries)
LINQ for data querying and manipulation
DateTime handling for scheduling logic

- Technical Implementations:

1 - Advanced C# Features:
Region organization for code clarity
Extension methods
Lambda expressions
LINQ queries
Null-coalescing operators

2 - Business Logic:
Sophisticated scheduling system with conflict detection
Real-time availability checking
Session management with status tracking
Multi-user support with role-based access

3 - Data Management:
In-memory data persistence
CRUD operations
Data validation and error handling

- UI/UX Considerations:

Unicode support for international character sets
Console-based user interface with color coding
User-friendly menu system
Input validation and error messaging

- Best Practices:

Comprehensive documentation
Consistent error handling
Code organization and maintainability
Version control ready (structured commits)
Defensive programming
Input validation
